# AdminFlow
> Inspired by usedash.ai

## Project Overview

**AdminFlow** is an AI-powered Admin Assistant Dashboard designed to automate and streamline business and administrative workflows. The platform enables users to create "AI employee workflows"â€”automated, intelligent agents that can perform complex business tasks through natural language commands and seamless integration with external tools and APIs. Inspired by platforms like Zapier and n8n, AdminFlow aims to make workflow automation accessible, flexible, and deeply integrated with modern AI capabilities.

## Vision

> Empower every business to automate repetitive and complex administrative tasks using AI-driven workflows, freeing up human time for higher-value work.

AdminFlow envisions a future where non-technical users can orchestrate powerful automations and integrations simply by describing what they want in natural language, while technical users can extend and customize workflows with advanced logic and integrations.

## Key Features & Goals

- **AI Employee Workflows**: Create, manage, and deploy AI-powered agents that automate business processes.
- **Natural Language Automation**: Define workflows and tasks using plain English prompts.
- **External Tool Integrations**: Connect with popular business tools (Gmail, Slack, CRM, Sheets, etc.) via OAuth and APIs.
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for designing and editing workflows.
- **Trigger & Schedule Automation**: Event-driven and scheduled workflow execution (e.g., "On new CRM lead", "Every Monday 8AM").
- **Collaboration & Permissions**: Team-based access, role management, and workflow sharing.
- **Execution Logs & Debugging**: Step-by-step run history, error tracking, and manual retry for failed steps.
- **Chat & Invocation**: Universal chat interface to invoke workflows or ask agents to perform tasks in natural language.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Track workflow performance, bottlenecks, and impact metrics.
- **Enterprise Security**: End-to-end encryption, compliance, and secure authentication (Supabase SSR, OAuth).
- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with Next.js 15, React Server Components, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive experience.
